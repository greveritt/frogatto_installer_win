This should eventually be a fully functional package of Frogatto 1.2 for Windows. So far, it can install the game but not uninstall it without deleting saves or without leaving data folders and their contents.

To get this to work, you must have a folder in the installer directory named "frogatto_msvc_bin" (without the quotes), and that folder must include all the files to be installed. I may include this folder in the repository at some point.
